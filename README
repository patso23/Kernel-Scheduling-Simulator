Sched.py contains the python code for my simulator.


In order to use the sim, you must pass 2 arguments on the command line, the first is a config file, then second an exec file, i.e.:
python sched.py config.cfg exec.ex

You may name the files anything you want.

Included are the provided config and exec files, and a sample of output using those files.
